 📘 AI Question Generator Based on Paragraph

I developed an intelligent **AI-based Question Generator** that analyzes academic or informative paragraphs using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and automatically generates a diverse range of questions for educational use.

This tool understands sentence structure, extracts key information, and formulates:

🔹 **Fill in the Blanks**  
🔹 **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**  
🔹 **Factual/Short Answer Questions**  
🔹 **Each question is tagged with marks**
