    "text": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate variations are natural, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been the main driver of climate change since the 1800s. The burning of fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures.",
